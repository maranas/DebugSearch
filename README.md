DebugSearch for Xcode
=====================

Allows filtering of debug output in Xcode.

Installation
============
Clone, build, then restart Xcode

Usage
====
There will be a text field added on top of your debug console view in the Xcode IDE. Just enter a string there and the output will be filtered accordingly.

Limitations
===========      
- No reg-ex yet.
- Once a user starts debugging interactively, filters are ignored.
